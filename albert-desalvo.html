            <p><strong>Who was Albert DeSalvo?</strong> He was an American serial killer who committed thirteen murders in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1962 and 1964. </p><p> DeSalvo was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in 1931. He had a troubled childhood, and he was often in trouble with the law. In 1957, he was convicted of breaking and entering, and he was sentenced to two years in prison. After his release from prison, DeSalvo moved to Boston, where he began his string of murders. </p><!--more--><p> DeSalvo's victims were all women, and they ranged in age from 19 to 55. He typically strangled his victims, and he often sexually assaulted them. DeSalvo was eventually arrested in 1964, and he was convicted of murder in 1967. He was sentenced to life in prison, and he died in prison in 1973. </p><p> DeSalvo's crimes terrorized the city of Boston, and his case is still studied by criminologists today. He is considered to be one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. </p><h2>Albert DeSalvo</h2><p> Albert DeSalvo was an American serial killer who terrorized the city of Boston in the early 1960s.

By understanding his methods, investigators were able to narrow down the list of suspects and eventually track him down. </p><ul><li><strong>Strangulation:</strong> DeSalvo typically strangled his victims with his bare hands or with a ligature. This method of killing is relatively quick and quiet, which allowed DeSalvo to avoid detection. </li><li><strong>Sexual assault:</strong> DeSalvo often sexually assaulted his victims before or after killing them. This behavior suggests that he was motivated by sexual sadism, which is a mental disorder characterized by the need to inflict pain or humiliation on others in order to achieve sexual gratification. </li><li><strong>Breaking and entering:</strong> DeSalvo typically gained entry to his victims' homes by breaking and entering. He would often enter through an unlocked window or door, or he would use a tool to pry open a window. </li><li><strong>Stalking:</strong> DeSalvo often stalked his victims before attacking them. He would follow them home from work or school, and he would sometimes even enter their homes and hide inside until they arrived. This behavior suggests that DeSalvo was carefully planning his attacks and that he was intent on targeting specific victims. </li></ul><p> DeSalvo's modus operandi was a key factor in his eventual capture. By understanding his methods, investigators were able to narrow down the list of suspects and eventually track him down. His crimes continue to be studied by criminologists today, and his case is a reminder of the importance of understanding the minds of serial killers. </p><h3>Victims</h3><p> Albert DeSalvo's victims were all women, and they ranged in age from 19 to 55. This fact is significant because it suggests that DeSalvo was not motivated by sexual desire, but rather by a need to control and dominate his victims. DeSalvo's victims were all vulnerable women, and he often targeted those who were living alone or who were otherwise isolated. This suggests that DeSalvo was carefully planning his attacks and that he was intent on targeting specific victims. </p><p> The fact that DeSalvo's victims were all women also suggests that he was motivated by misogyny. DeSalvo's crimes were a form of violence against women, and they reflect the deep-seated sexism that exists in our society. DeSalvo's crimes are a reminder of the importance of understanding the root causes of violence against women, and they underscore the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality. </p><p> The case of Albert DeSalvo is a complex one, and there is no single explanation for his crimes. However, the fact that his victims were all women is a significant factor that must be considered when trying to understand his motivations. DeSalvo's crimes were a form of violence against women, and they reflect the deep-seated sexism that exists in our society. DeSalvo's crimes are a reminder of the importance of understanding the root causes of violence against women, and they underscore the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality. </p><h3>Capture and conviction</h3><p> The capture and conviction of Albert DeSalvo was a significant event in the history of American crime. DeSalvo was one of the most prolific serial killers in American history, and his crimes terrorized the city of Boston in the early 1960s. His eventual capture and conviction brought a sense of relief to the city and helped to close a dark chapter in its history. </p><ul><li><strong>The investigation:</strong> The investigation into DeSalvo's crimes was one of the largest and most complex in Boston's history. Police officers worked tirelessly to track down leads and identify suspects. Eventually, they were able to link DeSalvo to the murders through DNA evidence. </li><li><strong>The trial:</strong> DeSalvo's trial was a media circus. The public was fascinated by the case, and the trial was covered extensively by the press.
