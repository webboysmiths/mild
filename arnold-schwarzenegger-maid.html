            <p><strong>Who was Arnold Schwarzenegger's maid?</strong></p><p> Mildred Patricia Baena was an American household staff member who worked as a housekeeper for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver for 20 years. She is best known for her extramarital affair with Schwarzenegger, which resulted in the birth of their son, Joseph Baena, in 1997. </p><!--more--><p> Baena was born in Guatemala and came to the United States in the 1980s. She began working for the Schwarzeneggers in 1991 and quickly became a trusted member of the household staff. She was responsible for cleaning, cooking, and running errands for the family. </p><p> In 2011, it was revealed that Baena had been having an affair with Schwarzenegger for over a decade. The affair resulted in the birth of Joseph Baena, who was born just days after Schwarzenegger's youngest child with Shriver. The revelation of the affair caused a major scandal and led to Schwarzenegger's separation from Shriver. </p><p> Baena has since left the employ of the Schwarzeneggers and has kept a low profile. She has never publicly discussed her affair with Schwarzenegger or her son, Joseph. </p><h2>Arnold Schwarzenegger's Maid</h2><p> The story of Arnold Schwarzenegger's maid, Mildred Patricia Baena, is a complex one that involves issues of power, infidelity, and family.
