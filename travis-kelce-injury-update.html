This information is important for the Chiefs, fantasy football owners, and Kelce himself. </p><h3>Impact on the Chiefs</h3><p> Travis Kelce is one of the most dangerous pass-catching tight ends in the NFL. He is a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses, and his ability to create mismatches all over the field makes him one of the most valuable players on the Chiefs' offense. Kelce's absence has been felt by the Chiefs' offense, as they have struggled to replace his production. </p><p> In the two games that Kelce has missed, the Chiefs have scored a total of 30 points, which is well below their season average of 32 points per game. The Chiefs have also struggled to convert third downs and red zone opportunities without Kelce on the field. In the two games that he has missed, the Chiefs have converted just 28.6% of their third downs and 50% of their red zone opportunities. </p><p> Kelce's absence has also had a negative impact on the Chiefs' passing game. In the two games that he has missed, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has completed just 58.3% of his passes for 455 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Mahomes has also been sacked six times in those two games. </p><p> The Chiefs are hoping that Kelce will be able to return to the field soon. He is a key part of their offense, and they need him to be at his best if they want to make a deep run into the playoffs. </p><p> Kelce's injury is a reminder of the importance of staying healthy. It is also a reminder of the importance of having a strong team around you, as the Chiefs have been able to weather the storm in Kelce's absence. </p><h3>Return to Practice</h3><p> The fact that Kelce has been participating in individual drills and is expected to return to practice soon is a significant development in his recovery from injury. It is a positive sign that he is progressing well and is on track to return to game action in the near future. </p><ul><li><strong>Increased Activity:</strong> Kelce's participation in individual drills is a sign that he is able to tolerate more activity and movement. This is an important step in his recovery, as it means that he is able to put more stress on his knee without experiencing pain or discomfort. </li><li><strong>Return to Practice:</strong> Kelce's expected return to practice is another positive sign. It means that he is close to being able to participate in full team activities and is on track to return to game action in the near future. </li><li><strong>Positive Outlook:</strong> The fact that Kelce is progressing well in his recovery is a positive outlook for the Chiefs. They need him to be at his best if they want to make a deep run into the playoffs. </li></ul><p> Overall, the fact that Kelce is returning to practice is a significant development in his recovery from injury. It is a positive sign that he is progressing well and is on track to return to game action in the near future. </p><h3>Return to Game Action</h3><p> The timeline for Kelce's return to game action is still uncertain, as the Chiefs are taking a cautious approach with their star tight end. Kelce has been participating in individual drills and is expected to return to practice soon, but it is still unclear when he will be cleared for contact and able to play in a game. </p><ul><li><strong>Medical Evaluation:</strong> The Chiefs' medical staff will continue to evaluate Kelce's knee and monitor his progress. They will need to be sure that his knee is fully healed and that he is able to withstand the rigors of game action before clearing him to play. </li><li><strong>Team Decision:</strong> Ultimately, the decision of when Kelce will return to game action will be made by the Chiefs' coaching staff.
